      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The object of Blackjack, also known as 21, is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over 21 (which known as going bust).</p>
        <p>You can change the deafult game settings or click play to begin.</p>
        <p>Click on the chips to place your bet. The bet amount will be deducted from your chip stack. Once placed, a bet cannot be changed. Click Deal when you are ready for the hand to begin.</p>
        <p>Initially two cards are dealt to each player face up, except the dealer, whose second card is dealt face down. The card point vaules, or scores, are shown to the right of the player's hands. Each card's score is its "pip" value, or 10 in the case of the picture ranks (Jack, Queen, King). Aces can be treated as 1 or 11. Being dealt an Ace with a 10, J, Q or K is known as a blackjack, and is an automatic win.</p>
        <p>Decide whether you want to Hit to get another card, or Stand if you are done and the hand can be played out.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Just like in a casino the cards will be shuffled at the start and again each time the deck is down to a low proportion of the cards left. (This stops players card counting.)</p>
        <p>Lastly, and most importantly, enjoy playing for fun!</p>

      <h3>"House Rules"</h3>
      <div class="modal-list">
        <ul>
          <li>Blackjack pays 1.5 times bet</li>
          <li>Win pays bet amount</li>
          <li>Draw returns bet</li>
          <li>Dealer hits on soft 17 (Ace + 6)</li>
          <li>Bets, once placed, cannot be changed</li>
          <li>Default play is with one deck of 52 cards</li>
          <li>Five cards max to a hand</li>
          <li>Deck shuffles when a quarter of cards remaining</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Basic Strategy</h3>
      <div class="modal-list">
        <ul>
          <li>Always take into account what the dealer's upcard is.</li>
          <li>Almost always hit until you reach seventeen, especially if the dealer's upcard is good - 7 or higher (7 to 10 or Ace).</li>
          <li>If the dealer has a poor upcard of 4, 5 or 6, don't take any chances and stand - they're most likely to bust!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>More About Blackjack</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Blackjack is also known as 21. While the popularity of Blackjack dates from World War I, its roots go back to the 1760s in France, where it was known as Vingt-et-Un. Today, Blackjack can be found in every casino.</p>
        <p>The standard 52-card pack is used and in most casinos several decks of cards are shuffled together. The six-deck game (312 cards) is the most popular.</p>
